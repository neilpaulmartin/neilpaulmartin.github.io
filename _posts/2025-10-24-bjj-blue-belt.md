After practising Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 11 months, I'm happy to say I got promoted to blue belt. I had the opportunity to attend a seminar from two of the UK's most seasoned grapplers, Darren Currie and Helen Currie. Helen is the UK's first female black belt in BJJ and they are both still in incredible shape.

Darren and Helen are both formerly students of Chris Haueter, one of the original Dirty Dozen pioneer black belts. The first ever non-Brazilian black belts.
