After the British governments decision to implement the [Online Safety Act](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer#what-does-the-online-safety-act-do), it is more important than ever to understand the implications of increasing overreach into our digital lives. Professor Tim Wilson sums the bill up quite well in the space of 11 minutes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJQ83TVRCgg).

Digital privacy is the right to control your personal information and how it is used online. In an age where our lives are increasingly digital, protecting this right is crucial. However, this is becoming increasingly difficult due to government overreach which has the intention to proliferate to technology companies.

The most recent [breach](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tea-app-leak-worsens-with-second-database-exposing-user-chats/) around on this topic is the Tea app breach where databases containing user information, picture verification and private chats were hacked. This same type of breach on a government system would be catastrophic, especially if it contained sensitive information such as health records or financial data.
